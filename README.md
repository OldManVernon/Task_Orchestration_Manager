The scratch folder contains test code for a small robot used for basic usage practice
The Attempt-1 folder includes the final deliverables that our 2.5 person team completed for a 3 month Senior Project. This includes a final report, RaspberryPi code and Arduino Code for the theoretical operation of a robot which would employ crab steering to follow a black line path (composed of straight lines connected by 90 degree turns) on an otherwise white background. The robot was designed to employ 4 drive motors and wheels, 1 motor which could control the orientation of the 4 drive wheels, and 4 IR sensors. The robot frame was fabricated out of laser cut wood and 3D printed parts to allow for rapid prototyping, but these materials proved to be insufficient, and so the code has not been confirmed to work on a physical robot.
